### Project Explanation and Tutorial

Charity is one of the ways a philanthropist can offer his sympathy. But, It is very unfortunate that
the Labour market and currency exchange rate is unstable. My team and I conducted research 
and we discovered that Charity organizations need to prepare for the unforeseen challenges in the
future such as; Government taxes, market rates, 
disaster(https://www.cafonline.org/about-us/publications/2019-publications/charity-landscape-
2019). Why is this necessary? The regular, continuous flow of income should be active in 
Charity organizations and should be diversified to relevant places. Expenses grow in 
milliseconds for the charity organizations due to the number of tasks they have at stake. For 
example, A orphanage home will want to cater for the expenses of the needed to keep the 
orphanage running, Relevant expenses might be Electricity bills, Building maintenance, Feeding 
and so on. The fact they need to take care of the bills at hand doesn't mean that the orphans will 
reduce, Statistics from UNICEF( https://www.unicef.org/media/media_45279.html) proves that 
the orphans been admitted will increase tremendously due to wars, unemployment and other 
negative factors. 
To solve this problem, We decided to develop a disaster contingency framework will help them 
to cope with the unforeseen.
According to UNDRR (https://www.undrr.org/terminology/contingency-planning#:~:text=A
%20management%20process%20that%20analyses,timely%2C%20effective%20and
%20appropriate%20responses.&text=Contingency%20planning%20is%20an%20important,be
%20regularly%20updated%20and%20exercised.), Disaster contingency framework is a 
management process that analyses disaster risks and establishes arrangements in advance to 
enable timely, effective and appropriate responses. 
The team were able to come up with a framework of how the expenditure management will look 
like. Here is the process of how the expenditure manager works: 
1.
It identifies the DIFFERENT SOURCES OF THE ORGANIZATION'S INCOME 
2.
Then, IT CALCULATE THE TOTAL INCOME FROM THE DIFFERENT 
SOURCES(PLUS ANY CARRIED OVER MONEY)
3.
After carefully deriving the total income, It identifies the organization's expenditures
4.
The resulting organization's expenditures will be categorized into primary and secondary 
level
5.
The next step is to GET THE AMOUNT OF EXPENDITURE PER DONATION TO BE 
MADE(with the range from minimum to maximum donation), For example, minimum to 
the maximum amount to be spent on feeding.
6.
The next step is to calculate the amount of all the expenditures using maximum 
expenditures
7.
After getting the amount of all the expenditures, we will arrive at three instances. The 
first instance is that if the total expenditure is greater than the income. The second 
instance is that if the expenditure and the income is at the same level. The third instance 
is that, if the total expenditure is lesser than the income, the remainder of the income can 
be kept and carried over for the next expenditure or diverted to another organization.
8.
Now the first two instances need to be broken down for clarification. The first instance 
which states that if the total expenditure is greater than the income, will result in one 
instance which is the total amount of all the expenditures will be calculated using the 
minimum expenditures. The second instance which states that if the expenditures and 
income is of the same level will result in two instances which are; if the organization is 
okay with it, they can dispatch the donation and if the organization wishes to retain some 
money, then some money can be deducted from the secondary expenditure category
9.
The previous instance from the first instance will result in three more instances which 
are; if the expenditure is still greater than the income then some money can be deducted 
from the secondary category. The next instance is that if the expenditure is lesser than the
income, it can be kept as carried over for the next expenditures. The last instance is that if
both are active, the expenditure is now balanced. 
10.
The final instance in the second instance is that, if the last two instances are active then 
the expenditure is balanced.

The coding section...
The code editor/IDE used for the web app is Visual studio 
code(https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the HTML colour picker is from 
w3schools.com. The inspiration for the website is http://thecodude.com/demo/tf/budget/?your-

The ExpendictureManager is the folder that comprises of all the files required to run the web 
app. Inside the ExpendictureManager folder, the first folder is the public section which 
comprises of the files, texts and codes to run the basic frontend of the web app. The next folder is
the src which comprises of the styling files, algorithm files, the web app icon, the banner, landing
page files, the setup files, service-worker files, app files, index files and javascript files(main 
required files to run the web app). The remaining files in the main folder are; gitinore, 
LICENSE, README, package-lock.json, package.json, yarn.lock, these are the files required to 
run the bootstrapped react package file of the web app.
The web app is hosted on netlify with the link: https://expenditure-manager.netlify.app. After 
opening this link on your browser, the next step is to click on "START" at the header or "START
MANAGEMENT" in the main body of the homepage. You'll be redirected to the page where 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
